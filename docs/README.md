## What is InferTrade?

InferTrade is a time series tool for traders and portfolio managers that offers the following functionality:

-   allows management of time series data from internal and external sources, import and export;
-   offers functionality to verify data and highlight data quality issues;
-   allows historical analysis of large data sets to identify trading rules that performed strongly;
-   provides inspiration for new trading rules through recommendations and optimisations.

Future objectives include:

-   automated data cleaning;
-   support for modelling benchmark tracking, fund NAVs and ETFs;
-   risk management and risk optimisation for multi-strategy portfolios.

InferTrade is currently planning to rely on partners/external plugins to provide:

-   P&L calculations for non-linear products;
-   supply of raw data and organisation of associated storage hierarchies;
-   in depth data visualisation and navigation functionality;
-   see-through or decomposed portfolio risk management capacities.
